Kazari is a touch gesture input library.

Setup
-----

To start, clone the repository. Say you're in your current project directory (directory where `main.lua` reside), run:

```
git clone https://github.com/MikuAuahDark/Kazari libs/kazari
```

You can change `libs/kazari` to `libs/hanachirusato` or anywhere else as long as you remember what name to use in `require` later.

To load the library, use `require`:

```lua
local kazari = require("libs.kazari")
```
